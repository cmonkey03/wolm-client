Ideas

1. Have one square that passes from right to left
  a.) squares = images
2. Avoid the squares instead of colliding into them
  a.) Have the score set to a certain number
  b.) Score decreases when player collides into squares
  c.) Keep the cursor in the frame to avoid cheating
  d.) Score would equal the number you have left when the timer is up
3. As soon as the player touches a single square, the game is over
  a.) Score = time
4. Levels
  a.) Speed could increase with time
  b.) Speed could increase with score
  c.) Levels = independent of score reporting

5. Make squares and sprite into avatars
