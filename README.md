# Website of Lower Manhattan
This is the single-page application for WOLM, a booking website where users can view tours, signup and make a reservation and request to be an administrator to view data and create tours.

## Tech used
- React
- Redux
- Thunk
- React-Router
- MomentJS
- OAuth
- Semantic UI React
- React-Spring

## Features
- Single-page app enabled by React-Router with site redirects and 404 page
- Adapter pattern accesses WOLM API through RESTful conventions
- Site authentication enables three-tier access: public, user and admin
- Four validated forms and six tables enable CRUD actions for three models: tours, users and admin
- Error and success messages are displayed after post, delete and update actions
- Optimistic rendering of updates to reduce API calls
- `componentDidUnmount` clears message displays

## Setup
1. If you'd like to fetch from the heroku-hosted WOLM API, go to `/src/adapter.js` and ensure line 2 is commented and line 4 is uncommented
2. If you'd like to fetch from a localhost WOLM API, clone down the [WOLM server](https://github.com/cmonkey03/wolm-server) and followed the setup instructions there.
3. Clone down this repo and run `npm install http-server`.
4. To fetch from a local WOLM API, go to `/src/adapter.js` and ensure line 4 is commented and line 2 is uncommented
5. Run `http-server -p 8000` from the command line and open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.
